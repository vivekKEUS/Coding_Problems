/**
 * There is a directed graph G with N vertices and M edges. The vertices are numbered 1,2,…,N, and for each i (1≤i≤M), the i-th directed edge goes from Vertex xi​ to yi​.

G does not contain directed cycles.

Find the length of the longest directed path in

G. Here, the length of a directed path is the number of edges in it.
Constraints

    All values in input are integers.

2≤N≤105
1≤M≤105
1≤xi​,yi​≤N
All pairs
(xi​,yi​) are distinct.
G does not contain directed cycles.
