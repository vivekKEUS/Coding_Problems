/*But, by looking at that, interviewer will say. I'm still not happy, so give him a flying kiss I mean give him a better solution ðŸ˜…

Now again, perform a beautiful acting, and say why dont we use MAP. So, tell him by using map, we can optimise it more beautifully.
So, what we'll gonna do is & may be you know this one, it is similar to Two Sum, so if u dont know then listen to me.

We gonna fill our map as frequency map. And we gonna get the result by subtracting current value from k & whatever result we get, we gonna check in our map. If that is present increment the count & remove it from the map now. That's how we'll get our answer in just O(1) for searching & as we are using a loop thus, O(N). But it's a good approach.
